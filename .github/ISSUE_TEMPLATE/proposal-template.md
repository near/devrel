name: Proposal Template
about: This is a template for incoming proposals to help the dev rel team manage sprint
  planning through async planning and communication.
title: "[EPIC or TASK] insert name of epic or task"
labels: proposal
assignees: crasskitty

---

### Instructions:
1. Fill out the proposal
2. Please select in the title if this is an Epic or a Task by deleting the word that does _NOT_ apply to what you are submitting.
3. Assign yourself to this issue and tag in at least one other team member (other than @crasskitty-- she's already assigned) to ask them to engage on your post!
4. Engage on other people's proposals. Use the proposals as a way to engage with each others ideas, poke holes in theories, and ask clarifying questions. Good Luck and have fun!


###  Common Questions:
#### What is an Epic and what is a Task?
- An Epic is an overarching goal, i.e. "Build a custom CRM". 
- A task is something that helps complete an Epic, i.e. "I need to import all of the companies in our network into this CRM".
- Most proposals will be tasks.
- _Note:_ Epics can span over a series of sprints!

#### Where can I learn more about this process?

### DELETE EVERYTHING ABOVE THIS LINE â†“

# Proposal for: [insert what you are proposing should be worked on in 10 words or less]

## What will be accomplished by completing this and who will it impact?
- (delete this line) describe what will be accomplished with as much detail as you can, and who it will impact.

## Which OKR(s) do this relate to?
- (delete this line) select all that apply by putting a `x` inside the brackets

- [ ] 1. Increase the number of **successful** apps running on MainNet
- [ ] 2.  Increase the number of **successful** developers deploying and improving their apps on TestNet
- [ ] 3. Support the continued maintenance of the material that will allow devs to self-serve and be **successful**

## What resources do you need to accomplish this?
- (delete this line) describe what resources you think you might or will need to accomplish this.

## What t-shirt size is this?
- (delete this line) select one by putting a `x` inside the brackets. **If it is an x-small amount of work, you do not need to make this proposal. _You can if you're an overachiever or overdocumenter, but its NOT required._**

- [ ] x-large (needs to be broken into smaller tasks, most likely an Epic)
- [ ] large (whole sprint & shouldn't be done alone)
- [ ] medium (anything half a week to a week)
- [ ] small (anything from half a day to a full day)
- [ ] x-small (less than half a day)

## What priority is this?
- (delete this line) select one by putting a `x` inside the brackets. If it is a true P0, we cannot finish this sprint without accomplishing it. Use sparingly.

- [ ] P0 (EMERGENCY, drop everything to put out the fire)
- [ ] P1 (Critical, docs, bugs or features that block work)
- [ ] P2 (Important, known docs, feature requests or known bugs)
- [ ] P3 (Nice-to-have, docs or features that improve a flow)



### So, DevRel Team, please comment below with the t-shirt size and priority you believe applies to this proposal, as well as why you feel this way!

#### Also, feel free to comment with your questions, concerns, thoughts, volunteer yourself as a resource, or tag in other people who may have more context!
